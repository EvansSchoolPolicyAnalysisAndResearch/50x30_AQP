<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Cambodia Agriculture Survey Data Explorer is a utility for policy
analysis, progress tracking, comparison, and reporting. It is designed
to be extensively user-modifiable so that commonly used graphics can be
quickly regenerated from a new data release, reducing the time between
collection and analysis. A public version of the app is available <a href="here">https://evans-par.shinyapps.io/agquery</a> and can be used
to immediately access the data and produce visualizations. The next
section will explain how to download your own copy in order to make best
use of these features, and the following sections will provide an
instructions on using and updating the content in each tab.</p>
<p>This app is built using Posit’s R Shiny framework. More information
on Shiny can be found <a href="here">https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/</a></p>

<h3>Adding Your Own Data</h3>
<p>Additional data can be added to the app by placing CSV files with raw
data in the Data subfolder. The following requirements must be met for
data files to be usable by the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>The file name must be “Cambodia_CAS_{YEAR}_{UNIQUENAME}.csv. The
unique name must be consistent across survey years.</li>
<li>The files must contain the <strong>ID variables</strong> “hhid”,
“province”, and “zone”</li>
<li>Variables in the data files can be named with a combination of
letters, numbers, and underscores. They should not include spaces or
begin with numbers. Variable names are case sensitive: the names
“Chickens” and “chickens” will be treated as different variables. Khmer
script is permitted.</li>
<li>All variables should be numeric; including string or categorical
data will result in errors or estimates that are difficult to interpret.
Consider adding them to the app as grouping variables instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two additional files, weights.csv and groups.csv, should follow the
same file naming convention outlined above and are used to store the
household-level weights and any categorical or grouping variables,
respectively. Both files are optional; if they are not included, all
data files should include weights and grouping criteria. If weights are
not found, the numbers presented in the app will represent the
unweighted (sample) totals and means.</p>
</div>
<div id="adding-new-variables-creating-your-own-policy-goals-setting-up-policy-pathways-and-determining-relevant-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Adding New Variables, Creating Your Own Policy Goals, Setting Up
Policy Pathways, and Determining Relevant Variables</h3>
<p>The app will register all variables included in the input data files
(see Diagnostics), but it will only incorporate the variables that have
been included in the Update folder spreadsheets to avoid presenting too
many options simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div id="policy-context" class="section level3">
<h3>Policy Context</h3>
<p>This page provides data and visualizations from both external sources
and the CAS for understanding the agricultural and economic context in
Cambodia. The Agricultural Sector Overview tab provides sector-wide
information, while the Commodity Overviews provide information related
to specific commodities. The colored <strong>value boxes</strong>
provide statistics sourced from the World Bank’s <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">Open Data repository</a>. Additional
indicators can be added by downloading the csv files from their
respective pages and placed in the Extdata subfolder in the main app
directory. New datasets will be discovered and included
automatically.</p>
<p>The commodities tab includes information of interest for specific
crops or livestock species. The categories can be customized by editing
the folders in the “Commodities” subfolder of the “Extdata” folder. The
names of these folders will be used to determine the titles of each tab.
Images downloaded from elsewhere can also be included; edit the
“image_information.csv” file in each commodity directory to edit the
titles and captions for the images.</p>
</div>
<div id="identifying-feasible-options" class="section level3">
<h3>Identifying Feasible Options</h3>
<p>This page provides a way to view and consider policies to address a
given policy goal.</p>
<p>Policy goals can be adjusted on the <strong>Policy Instruments by
Goal</strong> tab to tailor the app to their preferences by editing the
Policy_Pathways.csv spreadsheet in the Update folder or available as a
direct download from the provided link. For each policy goal, develop a
list of methods for achieving the goal, then determine the legal
instrument that could be used to implement each method. Assess the
instruments according to their effects on costs for producers
(<em>Producer unit costs</em>), prices paid by consumers (<em>Final
consumer price</em>), quantity of products exchanged in the market
(<em>Final prod Q</em>), the quality of the product (<em>Prod
quality</em>), and the relative time to implement the instrument by
passing laws or creating policies (<em>Speed</em>). Additional notes for
feasibility of implementation and the impacts of the existing trade and
legal framework can be added, or you can add your own columns. The
symbols ⬇, ⬆, ⬍ (used to indicate that a change is anticipated but the
direction is ambiguous), = (no change anticipated), and ? (outcome for a
non-directional criterion) will have special formatting applied; all
others will be shown as plain text.</p>
<p>The <strong>Stakeholder Mapping</strong> tab displays diagrams of
stakeholders in value chains that might be affected by new policies.
Images created using diagramming applications are displayed here.</p>
</div>
<div id="gather-evidence-assess-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Gather Evidence &amp; Assess Data</h3>
<p>This page allows users to summarize Cambodia Agriculture Survey data
organized around the policy goal. The <strong>Data Summaries</strong>
tab presents summary statistics and, when available, trends for
variables relevant to each policy goal. The variables associated with
each goal are set manually using the spreadsheets in the Update folder
(see <strong>Spreadsheet-Based Content Management</strong>, above). The
<strong>Evidence from the Literature</strong> tab shows a list of
citations relevant to the policy goals and can be updated using the
evidence_list.xlsx file in the Update folder.</p>
<p>To view estimates, begin by selecting a policy goal from the
drop-down menu. Once a selection is made, the app will summarize all of
the variables associated with that goal and present the Variable Summary
Table and mapping options. Selecting a pathway will reduce the number of
variables to just those identified as relevant to the policy instrument
selected. The Mean/Total switch toggles between presenting national (or
Zonal/Provincial) means to weighted totals.</p>
<p>Below the Variable Summary Table, the Detailed Information section,
when expanded, shows sample sizes and other information saved as notes
in the indicators spreadsheet.</p>
<div id="maps" class="section level5">
<h5>Maps</h5>
<p>A dropdown menu and a toggle switch will appear on the right side of
the screen after a policy goal is chosen. The dropdown menu contains all
the variables related to the policy/pathway, and the toggle switch can
be used to swap between aggregation to the provincial level and the zone
level. Selecting a variable will automatically draw the maps, the top
showing the value from the latest available year, and the bottom showing
the trend since the beginning of the survey series, when available. A
third line plot shows the national-level trend since the beginning of
the survey series.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-export" class="section level5">
<h5>Data Export</h5>
<p>The table data can be downloaded as a csv file using the “Download
Table Data” button. Maps can be saved by right clicking and saving the
image, and the plot can be exported using the menu. The button with the
<i class="fas fa-file-arrow-down" role="presentation" aria-label="file-arrow-down icon"></i>
symbol will download the data table for the first map.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="interpreting-data-relationships" class="section level3">
<h3>Interpreting Data Relationships</h3>
<p>While the Gathering Evidence tab provides a general overview, the
<strong>Interpreting Data Relationships</strong> page provides a more
detailed look and side-by-side comparison of selected variables. This
page can be used to visualize relationships between variables using a
correlation heatmap. The heatmap shows the strength and direction of
correlation between each pair of variables, with red indicating stronger
positive correlations and blue stronger negative correlations. Hover
over each dot to see the p-value of the correlation. Smaller values
indicate stronger certainty that the association is not the result of
chance variations in the data.</p>
<p>The organizational logic is the same as the Gather Evidence page,
with options appearing after a policy goal is selected. Options to
select two variables for a simple x-y comparison will appear, and those
options can be narrowed further by selecting a policy pathway. A second
button labeled “Show Heatmap” will also appear. Pressing this button
will show a correlation heatmap across all the variables under the
policy goal or the selected subset if a pathway is chosen.</p>
<p>All data processing will omit observations with empty or NA values
for one of the variables, but the checkbox “omit 0s from Y variable” can
be used filter the data further to include only observations where the
selected Y variable has a non-zero value. This can be used to make the
histograms easier to read or target a subpopulation of interest. For
example, if the selected Y variable is “number of chickens vaccinated,”
the unmodified results would include all chicken owners who did not
vaccinate any of their chickens, while omitting 0’s would include
results only for chicken owners who did vaccinate at least one
chicken.</p>
<p>Data can also be grouped along subpopulations of interest. If a
variable is included in the “groups.csv” spreadsheet in the raw data and
has an entry in the “grouping_vars.xlsx” spreadsheet in the Update
subfolder, it will appear in the list, and the results will compare
values across the categories in that group.</p>
<p>Once you have selected variables and modifications, press the
“Compare Variables” button to generate the graphs. Clicking the
<i class="fas fa-table" role="presentation" aria-label="table icon"></i>
button above each histogram will show a table of the values (this table
is omitted when viewing results at the household level due to the large
number of entries it would have). A scatter/line graph at the bottom
provides a quick assessment of the degree of correlation between the
selected variables using a linear model. While this is not a substitute
for rigorous statistical analysis, it can provide information about
hypothesized relationships between variables that can be explored
further using R or another statistical package using the raw data.</p>
<div id="data-export-1" class="section level5">
<h5>Data Export</h5>
<p>Data can be downloaded in one of three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The “Download Selected Raw Data” will provide observations
<strong>for only the variables selected in the dropdown boxes</strong>.
The optional selections (omitting 0’s, administrative level, and
grouping variables) will be honored in the data; therefore, selecting a
level other than household will provide a summarized dataset.</p></li>
<li><p>The “Download All Listed Raw Data” will provide the export format
as above, but for <strong>all of the variables related to the selected
policy goal and pathway</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The buttons with the
<i class="fas fa-file-arrow-down" role="presentation" aria-label="file-arrow-down icon"></i>
symbol will provide an spreadsheet version of the data table (for zone-
and province-level summaries) with in a format that can be read by the
app to reproduce the table on the <strong>Policy Context</strong> page
if the file is placed in the proper commodity folder. Do not change the
name of the file when using this feature.</p></li>

<div id="additional-considerations-sources-for-evaluating-options" class="section level3">
<h3>Additional Considerations &amp; Sources for Evaluating Options</h3>
<p>This page provides links to associated sources of data and
information that can be used to create further figures. Edits to this
table can be made by editing the Secondary_Sources.csv spreadsheet.</p>
</div>
<div id="app-diagnostics" class="section level3">
<h3>App Diagnostics</h3>
<p>In addition to the instructions you are currently reading, this page
provides the <strong>App Diagnostics</strong> tab, which can be used to
troubleshoot if the app stops working after an update. The app will
check that the data and supporting spreadsheets are present and
correctly formatted with the expected column names. In addition, it will
present all of the variables found in the data files and report whether
the metadata needed to incorporate them into the app are present. For a
variable to show up, it must at least be present in the indicators list
and be assigned to a policy goal. Assignment to a pathway is optional.
Note that this is not the case for the hhid, province, and zone
variables, which are used to identify observations. They should be
present in all of the data files with the exception of groups and
weights, which need only the unique household id.</p>
