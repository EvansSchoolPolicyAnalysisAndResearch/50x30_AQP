(2) The limiting properties of the environment are drought, soil acidity, flooding, and soil infertility, which must be addressed in the selection and management of forage genetics. (3) Broadly adapted perennial tropical grasses and herbaceous legumes exist, but these are unlikely to thrive in lowland ecosystems of southern Laos and Cambodia that are prone to both annual flooding and drought. (4) Variations in surface hydrology at the farm scale often result in differentiated environments suitable for differing varieties. Brachiaria sp. hybrid “Mulato II,” Panicum maximum, and Stylosanthes guianensis are recommended for drought-prone, acidic sands that are safe from prolonged submergence and would require the least additional management, whilst Paspalum atratum is recommended for low-lying areas with access to irrigation. (5) The transition to perennial forage integration appears to be accessible to farmers and can allow them to rapidly accumulate benefits in terms of saved labor; however, efforts to intensify animal production have been slow and must contend with multiple challenges: poor understanding of animal husbandry and health, cultural views relating to the role of animals in production systems, and poor access to forage and livestock services."""

Although keeping the eggs to raise chickens, which could then be sold, was not a negative outcome, it has implications for the potential of the program to improve MCHN outcomes through household production of animal-source foods. Income from selling the chickens could contribute to improving consumption of animal-source foods, as was found in a program in Bangladesh, but would work through the income pathway. Overall, components along the knowledge–adoption of optimal health- and nutrition-related practices pathway presented the most opportunities for feasible improvement. Such improvements could greatly increase the ability of the homestead food production program to contribute to improvements in MCHN outcomes. Evidence suggests that including a strong behavior change communication (BCC) strategy in agriculture programs results in better health and nutrition outcomes than in programs without such a strategy. Thus, optimizing these components of the homestead food production program is essential to increasing the program’s ability to improve MCHN outcomes."""
