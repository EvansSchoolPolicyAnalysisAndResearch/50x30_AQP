<h3>02/01/23 (v0.1.7-beta)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updates
<ul>
<li>Stealth 0.1.6 update meant to include Tanzania still on hold while we wrap up backend LSMS coding.</li>
<li>Minor modifications to NGA data; yield continues to be difficult to track for wave 4 due to uncertainties around land area; restricting to GPS-measured plots is currently the best remedy (GPS measurement appears to have differential impacts on yield depending on your crop - roots and tubers have substantially higher yields on unmeasured plots, while corn and legumes are lower).</li>
<li>The gps_area variable is now available in all NGA waves.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that was causing weights to be incorrectly computed for some variables.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that was causing duplicated entries in the raw data export; your workbook may have multiple sheets for variables that have different units of observation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Changes
<ul>
<li>Major update to charting section for a better data visualization experience</li>
<li>Crop disaggregation is now handled differently for a (hopefully) more intuitive user experience.</li>
<li>There is now a setting under the advanced options for restricting to panel households. If you get a “no data” error, it might be because a panel refresh happened between two of the waves in your selection.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Known Issues
<ul>
<li>Depending on your browser’s settings, the raw data may download in the background.</li>
<li>It’s still possible to generate crop-specific indicators (e.g., yield, area planted) without specifying a crop disaggregation. The estimates produced by doing so may or may not be coherent. Please take care when interpreting results that include multiple crops.</li>
<li>The changes for labor accounting in Nigeria wave 4 result in significantly lower estimates of total labor days worked, and, consequently, labor productivity is substantially higher. I think this is an artifact of instrument design and not the result of shifting labor patterns.</li>

<div id="section-9" class="section level3">
<h3>9/14</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updates
<ul>
<li>I introduced a filterset spreadsheet that can be used to define filters through excel so that we don’t have to go into the app to redefine them. I wrote a small script at the beginning that takes the household file and cuts it down to the filters on the spreadsheet to save on resource use during runtime, but it only runs if it can’t find the relevant files. If you update the spreadsheet, be sure to delete the <country>_<wave>_filterset.dta file so that it re-makes it. Otherwise you’ll get a “Filter criterion not found” error.</li>
<li>Added basic demographic indicators</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Changes
<ul>
<li>Added SSP grouping criterion</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Data
<ul>
<li>Lots of 0’s for kgs harvest in W4 - check to make sure they aren’t being artificially introduced.</li>
<li>Still some suspiciously high values for crop expenses</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Known Issues
<ul>
<li>The program is getting increasingly RAM-hungry, especially with the introduction of the distribution plots. One of the unfortunate consequences of being able to dynamically generate datasets is that we end up with a lot of data that need to be held in memory until the session ends or the user sends a new request.</li>
<li><del>The variable “farm_size_agland” is still showing up in places where it shouldn’t</del> (Fixed)</li>
<li>Need a reset button for main options</li>
<li><del>The ag household filter doesn’t actually do anything yet</del> (Done!)</li>
<li><del>Still need to include variable descriptions</del> (Done 9/15)</li>
</ul></li>

<h3>9/13</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updates
<ul>
<li>Chart export is now available.<br />
</li>
<li>Filtering by administrative level is now functional (note: going down to small units can create seriously messy graphs and suck up system resources; also, administrative levels will need to be harmonized across countries to ensure program runs correctly)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Changes
<ul>
<li>Updates to UI to include filtering, improve screen real estate usage</li>
<li>Implemented raincloud plots on the data distribution tab</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Data
<ul>
<li><del>Crop expenses for NGA W2 appear to be compiling incorrectly (labor valuations are still off?)</del>
<ul>
<li>Values are being pulled up by a few extreme results; winsorizing should take care of this issue. Some labor expenses are high because the number of labor days seems off (&gt;365 days)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Need to double check palm oil conversions in W4 to make sure they’re working correctly</li>
<li>In general, plot data is very swingy and sensitive to outlier data, even with winsorizing. Crop expenses look weird for W3, and inorganic fertilizer rate looks weird for W2. Need to fix.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Known Issues I’m Currently Working On
<ul>
<li><del>I’m not 100% sure the inflation correction is working.</del> (Fixed)</li>
<li><del>Family labor days are not being picked up when requested</del> (Fixed 9/22)</li>
<li>Lots of 0’s for kgs harvest in W4 - check to make sure they aren’t being artificially introduced.</li>
<li><del>Winsorization code doesn’t work properly when custom ranges are used</del> (Fixed)</li>
<li><del>Data distribution graphing isn’t particularly helpful</del> (Addressed?)
<ul>
<li>Changed from box plots to raincloud plots. The large sample sizes mean that things took a while to render and the dot plot portion obscured the box plot. I removed dot plots for now but can add them back in.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><del>Data tables will periodically decide not to render</del> (Fixed)</li>
<li><del>The variable “farm_size_agland” is used both as an indicator and a source of filtering criteria, causing it to show up multiple times in the results.</del> (Fixed)</li>
<li>Need a reset button for main options</li>
<li><del>The ag household filter doesn’t actually do anything yet</del></li>
</ul></li>
